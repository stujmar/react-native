## What I have done here.
---
If you haven't already install React Native CLI

```bash
i -g react-native-cli
```
or (requires no other sdks?)
```bash 
i -g creact-react-native-app 
```
then generate your app
```bash
react-native init yourAppName
cd yourAppName
react-native run-andriod
```
see if that works on your piano
